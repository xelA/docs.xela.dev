  text: God, I love this bot, xelA! She got what we all needed - for moderation, fun commands, music, etc. It's a life saver! Especially for a server with thousands of members to accommodate. What I love more about this bot is how neat her codes are and how helpful is her developer is. Trust me, you have to have this in your server and you won't regret it.

  text: We use xelA on a number servers ranging in size (1k/7k) and have been able to completely replaced the large numbers of mod/uiltiy bots (including rowboat and a raido bot) we had been using to have a full set of features with just xelA, we get a ton trolls/raids on boobbots server the auto mod features allow my staff to be as lazy as ever with the server as clean as it could be, 10/10 bot 10/10 support
